# House Price Prediction

In this project, we have predicted the price of houses on the basis of various parameters like altitude, amount of bedrroms, location etc and then made a model using linear regression after splitting the data into training and testing results.
## Description

- We used Linear Regression Model for this project.
It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.

The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the relationship between the variables.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```
- We got a testing result of 64.9% in our regression model.
